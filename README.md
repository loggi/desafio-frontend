## Hi, youâ€™re welcome to the new Loggi's package tracker Interface

Our new package tracker Interface has been changed to offer the users a better interaction experience. More objective concepts and information about the package situation. Where it's, when it probably arrives. All in real time and easily accessible. :sunglasses:

**[Checkout the new interface preview here &rarr;](https://loggi-challenge.netlify.app/)**

To interact with the new interface, test any of the following trackers codes :point_down:
