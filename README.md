# Tracking Page

The Tracking Page is an essential area of Loggi's Website that provides users with the ability to track their packages and stay informed about their delivery status. With this feature, users can easily monitor the progress of their shipments and know exactly when to expect their packages.

## Testing with Mock Tracking Codes

To test the application's functionality, you can use one of the following mock tracking codes: 1, 2, or 3. Each tracking code will produce different results to showcase the informative error handling capabilities of the application.

## API Mock

This application leverages an API mock, which allows for seamless testing and development without relying on a live API. The API mock provides realistic responses and data to simulate real-world scenarios, ensuring a smooth user experience.

Feel free to explore the Tracking Page and experience the convenience of tracking your packages with ease. If you encounter any issues or have any feedback, don't hesitate to reach out to us. We are continuously improving our services to provide you with the best experience possible.

Thank you for using Loggi's Tracking Page!
